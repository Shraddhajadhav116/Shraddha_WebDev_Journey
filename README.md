#  Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal journey of learning **Web Development** – a hands-on, concept-by-concept progression through **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with real-world projects like a **Spotify clone** built from scratch.

This repository is a live reflection of my learning path, coding consistency, and growth mindset.
